# AI-ML-in-Practice Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights my applied work in **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**.  
Each project demonstrates end-to-end workflows, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building, evaluation, and visualization.

I am passionate about applying ML/AI to solve real-world problems in **healthcare, fraud detection, sustainability, and business intelligence**.

## Projects Showcase

### Breast Cancer Prediction
This project uses machine learning models to classify breast cancer cases using real medical data, and it includes:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature importance visualization  
- Cross-validation  
- Model comparison (various classifiers)
**Goal:** Support early detection of breast cancer through predictive modeling.

### Customer Behavior Prediction
This project uses ML models to predict customer churn and behavior patterns.
Analyzed customer transaction data to predict churn and behavior patterns.  
Applied **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and data visualization techniques**.  
**Goal:** Help businesses reduce churn and improve customer retention.

### Pet Re-Identification
This project builds a deep learning Siamese Network for pet re-identification, and it includes:  
- Pairwise image comparison using contrastive learning  
- Database search to identify lost pets
**Goal:** Assist shelters and owners in reuniting lost pets using AI.
