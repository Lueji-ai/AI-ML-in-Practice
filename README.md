# AI-ML-in-Practice Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights my applied work in **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**.  
Each project demonstrates end-to-end workflows, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building, evaluation, and visualization.

I am passionate about applying ML/AI to solve real-world problems in **healthcare, fraud detection, sustainability, and business intelligence**.

## Projects Showcase

### Breast Cancer Prediction
Try the live demo: [BreastCancerPred (Hugging Face Space)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/phaphety2025/BreastCancerPred)  
Developed ML models to classify breast cancer cases using medical data. Includes EDA, feature importance, cross-validation, and model comparisons.  
Goal: Support early cancer detection through predictive modeling. 

### Customer Behavior Prediction
Analyzed customer transaction data to predict churn and behavior patterns. Applied **Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and data visualization techniques**.  
**Goal:** Help businesses reduce churn and improve customer retention.  

### Pet Re-Identification
Try the live demo: [pet-reid-app (Hugging Face Space)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/phaphety2025/pet-reid-app)  
Built a deep learning Siamese Network for pet re-identification. Implemented contrastive learning for pairwise image comparison and database search.  
Goal: Assist shelters and owners in reuniting lost pets using AI.
