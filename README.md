\# AI-ML-in-Practice Portfolio  



Welcome! This portfolio highlights my applied work in \*\*Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\*\*.  

Each project demonstrates \*\*end-to-end workflows\*\*, from \*\*data preprocessing and feature engineering\*\* to \*\*model building, evaluation, and visualization\*\*.  



I am passionate about applying ML/AI to solve \*\*real-world problems\*\* in healthcare, fraud detection, sustainability, and business intelligence.
